F3 SOIL is the (SO)uthern (IL)linois and St. Louis Metro East region of [F3](https://f3nation.com/).
The mission of F3 is to plant, grow, and serve small workout groups for men for the invigoration of male community leadership.

Fitness: This is why we initially show up. We want to get in better shape and we find that this is more rewarding in a group. Iron sharpens iron.

Fellowship: A cup of coffee is surprisingly refreshing after a workout and even more so is the chatter.

Faith: F3 is not a religious organization but men are best when they are part of something bigger than themselves so we encourage service to your faith, family, friends, and community.

title = 'Where are the workouts held?'
body = '''
Our locations are listed under the Locations menu in the upper-right.
Reach out (below) or just show up.
We rarely cancel a scheduled workout so it's almost guaranteed we'll be there.

You should dress appropriate for the weather.
If it's cold out be sure to layer so you can peel a layer off if you get too hot.
Working gloves (leather, heavy-duty latex, etc.) are a good idea.
We'll typically gift you a 35 lb cinderblock to use for weighted exercises.

title = 'What sort of exercises will I be doing?'
body = '''
We do standard body-weight exercises such as push-ups, jumping jacks, and squats.
We also make use of a 35 lb cinderblock to do exercises such as overhead presses, kettlebell swings, and curls.

title = 'How intense will the workout be?'
body = '''
We always say, "push yourself, don't hurt yourself."
We encourage all participants to modify as needed, up or down, so that they get an invigorating and safe workout.

The credo fo F3 is, "Leave no man behind, but leave no man where you find him."
We strive to ensure no man is left working alone so regularly "pickup the six" by contributing reps, joining in on reps, or holding a static hold in support.
