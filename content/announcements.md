## Special Announcements

- Rocky Top's daughter, Kaila, has begun a women's group modeled after F3, codenamed F4.
    They currently meet at 06:00 at several locations throughout the week.
    If any women in your life would be interested please reach out to Kaila at kailayoung03@gmail.com or to Rocky Top to get them connected; they use Discord instead of Slack.
