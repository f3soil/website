AO Nomad is focused on providing the option to Ruck.
However, unlike most AOs, Nomad is not held at a single location but instead meets at theses locations on their specific day:

* Tuesday in [Glen Carbon](https://goo.gl/maps/jFHs7n4gkDgeAtq97) at the Heritage Trailhead, at Old Troy Road and Mont Road
* Sunday at [Oâ€™Fallon](https://goo.gl/maps/JQhFPwAVBya71Qac8) at the Goshen Trailhead across from E.A. Fulton Junior High
