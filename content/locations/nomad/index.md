AO Nomad is a unique AO which is focused on providing the option to Ruck, Run, or Ride.
All three options are by their nature activities which span significant distances and so it seemed fitting that perhaps the AO was not locked to a particular location but to the network of MCT Trails that weave across our counties.
AO Nomad will have a regular schedule but will “make camp” across a series of trailheads:

- [O’Fallon](https://goo.gl/maps/JQhFPwAVBya71Qac8) at the Goshen Trailhead across from E.A. Fulton Junior High School
- [Collinsville](https://goo.gl/maps/PBLbu43WUK7c2LKYA) at the MEPRD Trailhead off of IL-157, behind Culver's
- [Maryville](https://goo.gl/maps/v1dPtpuXb2pBbBaY6) at the Schoolhouse and YMCA Trailhead off of IL-159 and I-55, beside the Maryville YMCA
- [Troy](https://goo.gl/maps/GgpWc7vijBxReXg57) at the Goshen Trailhead off of IL-162 and Old Troy Road, near Maryville Christian School
- [Glen Carbon West](https://goo.gl/maps/GjgEZjy7z6c7uWZC7) at the Glen Carbon Park & Ride, near IL-157 and IL-162
- [Glen Carbon East](https://goo.gl/maps/jFHs7n4gkDgeAtq97) at the Heritage Trailhead, off of Old Troy Road and Mont Road
