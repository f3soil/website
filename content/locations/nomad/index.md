AO Nomad is focused on providing the option to Ruck.
However, unlike most AOs, Nomad is not held at a single location but instead meets at these locations on their specific day:

* Tuesday in [Glen Carbon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jFHs7n4gkDgeAtq97) at the Heritage Trailhead, at Old Troy Road and Mont Road
* Sunday at [Oâ€™Fallon](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NemGrzRpdcMkccc47) at Rock Springs Park
