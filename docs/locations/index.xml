      <description>Can you pronounce Bolm-Schuhkraft Park? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a sprawling 44.5 acres park and is also known as City Park but we in F3 call it &amp;ldquo;The Black Forest&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a perfect place for your morning workout!
The Black Forest is well stocked for an F3 mother-of-all beatdowns. It&amp;rsquo;s got benches and picnic tables, 4 pavilions with tables (really useful on those wet, dreary mornings), basketball courts, batting cages, exercise stations, horseshoe pits, a 1 mile paved trail, roller hockey rink, sand volleyball court, sports fields, tennis courts, and more!</description>

      <description>Right in the middle of the Metro East, O&amp;rsquo;Fallon is the perfect place for a beatdown! The community park is located in the center of the community, which means easy come and easy go. Join us in the gloom as we keep giving it away in the Metro East.</description>

      <description>Just because workouts are held at Bicentennial Park, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean all exercises require 200 reps. But don&amp;rsquo;t be surprised if 200 makes a few appearances here and there. With plenty of amenities like nature trails and even disc golf, beatdowns are sure to be creative here.</description>

      <description>You don&amp;rsquo;t go to The Store to get new clothes, just a good old-fashioned beatdown. The Store has hillside terrain, basketball courts, a sand volleyball court, and more. You may even run into a deer or maybe even Bambi&amp;rsquo;s wife. BTW, do not park on the front-right spots!</description>
